### Quad-trees are a tree data-structure very useful to save and keep track of regions of space. Hence the name, quadrants tree.
### The root of the tree is the whole 2D area we are looking into. Then we have nodes that are quadrants of that region, and each node
### can have up to 4 quadrants of themselves.
