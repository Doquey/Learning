## What it is
Docker is a framework/language that lets users create containers inside images that serve as fresh new machines to work on. 

## What it is used for
The main reason people use Docker is to make the deployment of apps easiear and also to make code that can run in basically any Machine in the world.
Because when you create a docker container its like you're creating a shareable computer. You only install in that computer the things your program needs to run.
Therefore when a user downloads your code, if its in a docker container they will only need to run the code inside the container and the program will work 100%

## How to use it

The way I can find to learn about docker is to go to the docker tutorial from daedalus: https://daedalus-tech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/2413395999/Docker+-+From+Zero+to+Hero
