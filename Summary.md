# *Sort-tracking algorithm summarization*
### Section 1 : I will be summarizing how the algorithm works and how we can do tracking on a video with it. Bellow are the steps the algorithm uses to get to tracking.

- Detection
- Estimation
- Target Association
- Track identify life cycle

## Detection

### Section 1: Overview of detection techniques

In this section, I will provide an overview of various detection techniques used in the sort-tracking algorithm.

### Section 2: Performance evaluation

Here, I will discuss the performance evaluation metrics for the detection component in the sort-tracking algorithm.

## Estimation

### Section 1: Estimation models

I will explain different estimation models employed in the sort-tracking algorithm in this section.

### Section 2: Evaluation results

This section will present the evaluation results and analysis of the estimation component.

## Target Association

### Section 1: Association algorithms

Here, I will describe the association algorithms used for target association in the sort-tracking algorithm.

### Section 2: Performance comparison

In this section, I will compare the performance of different association algorithms implemented in the sort-tracking algorithm.

## Track Identity Life Cycle

### Section 1: Initialization

I will discuss the initialization process of track identities in the sort-tracking algorithm in this section.

### Section 2: Track maintenance and termination

Here, I will explain how track identities are maintained and terminated throughout the life cycle.
